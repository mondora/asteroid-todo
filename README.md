#asteroid-todo

A demo of [asteroid](https://github.com/mondora/asteroid), an
lightweight javascript client for [Meteor](https://meteor.com).

This demo aims to show the flexibility asteroid gives to the
developer, allowing them to take advantage of most of the great
features of Meteor (data sync, federated login, latency compensation
etc) in a variety of environments.

The demo can also be considered an example of how to use asteroid.
